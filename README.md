# cDOT-CIFS-share-backup-restore
These PowerShell scripts allow storage administrators to back up and restore CIFS share and NFS export policies/rule configurations for storage virtual machines in NetApp's clustered Data ONTAP. These require the NetApp PowerShell Toolkit module to be installed. These scripts are not officially supported by NetApp (but the PowerShell modules are) and should be used only with thorough testing.

Special thanks to Scott Harney for the NFS export backup contribution.
